==== WHATSNEW for eComStation 2.1 GA Release, since eComStation 2.0 GA ====

New Features:

  environments without sacrificing a primary partition (required for most 
  Windows 7 preloads)

  deliver considerably better performance than regular SATA controllers.

  controller + disks can properly initialize. Driver is added by OS2CSM and 
  HWMERGE when a SCSI driver is selected.
