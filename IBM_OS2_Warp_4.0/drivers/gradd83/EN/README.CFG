   VIDEO CONFIGURATION A CID ENVIRONMENT
  ______________________________________

  This utility will allow for you to select a
  monitor, resolution and refresh rate as part
  of a CID installation.

  The utility "VCFGCID.CMD" is a command file which
  is called from a SDM (Software Distribution
  Manager) and which takes the following parameters:

  vcfgcid /L1:<Error Log>                    - Name of error log file
          /L2:<History Log>                  - Name of history log file
          /RES:<HORIZONTALxVERTICALxCOLORS>  - Resolution i.e. 1024x768x256
          /MON:<Monitor Index>               - Index of selected monitor in
                                               "MONITOR.DIF" file (see below)
          /PMI                               - Indicates that the utility should
                                               regenerate the svgadata.pmi file
                                               if selected monitor has greater
                                               capabilities than default monitor
          /RR:<Refresh Rate>                 - Desired refresh rate for selected
                                               resolution

  "/L1:" and "/L2:" are optional.  You must specify at
  least one of "/RES:", "/MON:" or "/RR:"

  The monitor "Index" passed as the value for parameter
  "/MON:" needs to be obtained from the "monitor.dif"
  file installed on the client system.  A utility has
  been included "getmonid.cmd" which will search the
  monitor.dif file for specified keywords and return
  the index values.

  getmonid <key word> [<key word> ...] [-d <Monitor dif file>]

       where  "-d <Monitor dif file>" is optional and allows
              for the specification of a an explicit "monitor.dif"
              file.  If not specified than the DPATH is searched
              for "monitor.dif"

e.g.

  getmonid ibm 15p -d monitor.dif

  returns:

  Index: 136 OEMString = "IBM 15PT/15XT TouchScreen Color Monitor 15 inch, IBM Corporation"
  Index: 135 OEMString = "IBM 15P/15X/15XG Color Monitor 15 inch, IBM Corporation"

  Choose the index which corresponds to the monitor you wish to be
  selected.

  To configure video for your system using CID, you must install
  the appropriate display support and reboot. Then use the following
  information to modify your LCU (LAN Configuration, Installation
  and Distribution Utility) command file.

  Note:  LCU and related documentation/utilities are provided
         as applets included with the IBM MPTS (Multi-Protocol
         Transport Services) product which is included with
         IBM Lan Server V3.0, V4.0 and OS/2 Warp server products.
         Please refer to the documentation which comes with these
         products for further information on LCU.

  NOTE:  The following information is meant as a guide.
         Your LCU command file might be different.

  NOTE: You must have already installed and be running the appropriate display
        driver.  You cannot install the display driver and run this utility in
        one pass.  Simply have your cid installation install the driver and
        then reboot the system before running this configuration utility.

  Following is an explanation of the line that is
  executed in the LCU command file:

    C:\OS2\INSTALL\VCFGCID /l1:c:\os2\install\vcfgerr.log
    /l2:c:\os2\install\vcfghist.log /res:1024x768x256
    /rr:75 /pmi /mon:135

       /l1:c:\os2\install\vcfgerr.log
        is the log file for any errors that may occur

       /l2:c:\os2\install\vcfghist.log
        is the log file for documenting results of calls
        to vcfgcid

       /res:1024x768x256
        is the desired resolution/color depth.  If not supported
        by the current adapter than will default to supported
        resolution.

       /rr:75
        set the vertical refresh rate to 75hz.  If not supported
        than will default to supported resolution

       /pmi
        tells utility to regenerate the svgadata.pmi file with
        new monitor capabilities

       /mon:135
        select monitor corresponding to index 135.  In this case
        we choose "IBM 15P/15X/15XG Color Monitor 15 inch, IBM Corporation"

  NOTES:

  1.  If by selecting a new monitor a new svgadata.pmi file
      is generated, the utility will cause a "reboot with
      callback" and then configure resolution/refresh rate
      if needed
